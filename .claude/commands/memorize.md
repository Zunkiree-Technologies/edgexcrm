# MEMORIZE SESSION - Edge-X-CRM-Stark

You are saving this session's learnings to the Edge-X CRM project brain.

## MEMORIZE PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Analyze This Session

Review the conversation and identify:
1. **What was accomplished** - Features built, bugs fixed, decisions made
2. **Technical learnings** - New patterns, solutions discovered
3. **Blockers encountered** - Problems and their solutions
4. **Decisions made** - Technical or architectural choices
5. **Next steps** - What should happen next session

---

### Step 2: Update Brain Files

#### A. Update Status (`status-current.md`)
- Update "Last Updated" date
- Mark completed tasks
- Add new blockers (if any)
- Update sprint progress

#### B. Log Decisions (`decisions-log.md`)
For any significant decisions made:
```markdown
### [Date]: [Decision Title]
**Context:** Why this decision was needed
**Decision:** What was chosen
**Rationale:** Why
**Status:** Active
```

#### C. Add Patterns (`workflow-patterns.md`)
If you discovered reusable patterns:
- Code patterns
- Workflow improvements
- Solutions to common problems

#### D. Create Session Log
Create a new file in `.brain/session-logs/` with format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Include:
- Date and duration
- What was accomplished
- Technical details
- Decisions made
- Learnings
- Next steps

---

### Step 3: Report Summary

After updating files, provide:

```
SESSION MEMORIZED

FILES UPDATED:
- [List of files updated]

SESSION LOG: .brain/session-logs/[filename].md

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- [Bullet points]

LEARNINGS CAPTURED:
- [Patterns or decisions logged]

NEXT SESSION SHOULD:
- [Priorities for next time]

---
Brain updated. Context preserved for next session.
```

---

## Cross-Project Patterns

If you discovered patterns that could help OTHER projects:
1. Note them in the session log
2. Flag for Global Sadin-Stark extraction
3. Mark as "Cross-Project Value: HIGH/MEDIUM"

Example patterns worth escalating:
- Generic code solutions
- Workflow improvements
- Tool configurations
- Error handling patterns

---

## Important Notes

- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on what future sessions need to know
- Don't duplicate information already in brain files
- Update, don't overwrite (preserve history)
